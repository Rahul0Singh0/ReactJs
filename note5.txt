Hooks: ->Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function component
       ->Hooks allow you to use React without classes. It means you can use state and other React features 
         without writing a class.
       ->React provides a few built-in Hooks like useSate, useEffect etc.
       ->Hooks are introduce in React 16.8
       When use Hooks: If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it.
       all those are using in class component and can't use directly in functional component
       like state, Life Cycle Methods etc.... can be use in functional component also with the help of 
       hooks
