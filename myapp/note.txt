React Js is a library of javascript to use for building user interface.
We can achieve validation and many more...
Requirement : HTML, CSS and ECMAScript6
Once create component then reuse anytime and anywhere
JSX =>

## npm vs npx vs yarn
**Imp command :
      1) Node version check : npm -v
      2) npm & npx version  : npx/npm -v

npm : all dependencies install on my system using npm tool then execute it 
      node package manager is a tool which helps to setup our project.
      mainly used to install packages.
      you will have your own react-app project in place without the need to install create-react-app itself
      1. npm install -g create-react-app
      2. create-react-app reactproject

npx : node package execute is a tool which helps to setup the project. 
      to execute packages.
      if u want to execute a package(dependencies) without installing it on ur computer 
      and then launch it u can use npx directly.
      1. npx create-react-app mp-app

dependencies: A dependency is a piece of code—a library, a module, or a package—that
              a project requires to function correctly. In Node. js, dependencies and
              devDependencies are categories of packages you can define in your package.
              json file to manage your project's dependencies

Lecture 3: DOM => Document Object Model
           Document = HTML Document
           Object   = Html Elements or tags
           Model    = Complete Document (in which all objects are arrange)

      Virtual DOM : is a replica of existing DOM(copy of original DOM)
           In react for every DOM object, there is a corresponding "Virtual DOM"
           object. A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object like a lightweight copy
           It has same properties as a real DOM object but it lacks the real thing's power
           to directly change what's on the screen.

Lecture 4: all installed dependencies in node_modules folder are listed in package-lock.json file'
           File structure of react app
              1. top file index.html(src folder) root div in this file
              2. index.js(src) start execution from here
              3. App.js all elements/objects created in Document from this file
            

Lecture 5: JSX is a javascript XML (XML stands for Extensible Markup Language)
           XML provide rules to define any data
           JSX is a syntax extensive for Js
           JSX lets you write HTML like markup inside a JS file
           Although there are other ways to write components, most react developers prefer the conciseness of JSX
           example : const e = <h1> Hello </h1>
           JSX introduce in ECMAScript6

           Note: can use one component into another components.
           Note: A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies 
                 the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the 
                 relationship between its parts. Markup can control the display of
                 a document or enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.
