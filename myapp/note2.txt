Event Handling: 

Note: A function is an independent. Doesn't need any object(declare in functional component)
      while method is a function, which is linked with any object(declare in class component)
      
note: forcefully stopped/prevent the Event, using preventDefault()function
      it works like return false

Fragment:  

map : 

CallBacks: are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed. 
           By something here we mean a function execution.
           If u want to execute a function, then CallBacks can be used.
           Note: JS functions have the type of objects. So, much like any other objects(String, Arrays etc.)
                 They can be passed as an argument to any other function while calling.
            example:
                  function add(a, b, callback) {
                        document.write(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a+b}`);
                        callback();
                  }

                  function disp() {
                        document.write("This must be printed after add");
                  }

                  add(5, 6, disp)

                  or 

                  add(5, 6, disp() {
                        document.write("This must be printed after add");
                  })
