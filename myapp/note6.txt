Angular VS React


Retrieve the position(x,y)

Context: In a typically React Application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but this can be cumbersome
         for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within 
         an Application.
         Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually 
         at every level.

High Order Component: HOC is an advanced technique in React for reusing 
        component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se.
        They are a pattern that emerges from React's composition nature.
