that can then be reused and handled independently.

One component can contain multiple HTML elements/objects

Functional Components
    
    1.  Functional Components are basic JS functions. These are typically arrow functions
        but can also be created with the regular function keyword.
    2.  React lifecycle methods (for example, ComponentDidMount) cannot be used in functional Components (used in class component).
    3.  There is no render method used in functional Components.
        means it is use only where there are only return html elements/objects( whenever create only UI )
    4.  These are mainly responsible for UI and are typically presentational only (for example, a button component).
    5.  Functional components can accept and use props(props is a property).

     state and return our JSX code to the root component of our app.
